### Collection of Information

We colect basic information such as name, email and password as part of the login/register functionality, we also collect some standard app information to help us improve Moovee.

### Information automatically collected:
- Anonymized crash logs.
- General anonymized usage statistics (e.g Moovee users add or remove items from the watchlist). We can't tell who performed this action.
- We use Google Ads to provide the ads in the movie/tv show details. Ads are displayed automatically by Google.

### Use of Information

As a rule of thumb, information we collect is only used to either fix bugs/crashes or to help us better understand how Moovee users use the app. For example, which parts are used more than others of the app (e.g Discover or Profile?). We only use information to provide, analyze, administer, and enhance Moovee.
